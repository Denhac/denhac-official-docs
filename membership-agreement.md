**Membership**

1. **Agreement, Limitation of Liability & Waiver**
    All members, guests, and participants enter into this Agreement as a condition of membership and as a part of participating in denhac activities and/or events, and extends to denhac and its affiliates. All members, guests, and participants have read, understood, agreed to and signed [denhac's "Waiver and Release of Liability, Indemnification and Assumption of Risk, and Hold Harmless Agreement"](http://denhac.org/waiver) herein called "Waiver," which will be provided simultaneously with this Membership Agreement prior to the use of facilities and/or attendance at any workshop provided by denhac. No member or non-member is permitted to use the facilities, tools, or machinery for any reason without the acceptance and signing of the Waiver. Acceptance of this Membership Agreement implicitly constitutes acceptance of the waiver as well.

2. **Membership Term**

    The Membership Term and Member's obligations to pay monthly Membership Dues will be structured as follows:
    1. Pending Member signs up online through the website. Their payment is accepted, saved, and their account is created. The membership subscription is immediately paused, and no further payments will be collected until Member has been issued a keycard. They are provided instructions to visit the space in person in order to have their ID verified and to be issued an access keycard.
    2. Pending Member visits the space, speaks with a denhac Agent, has their ID verified, and is issued an access keycard to the building. Keycards usually activate within a few minutes. When a keycard is issued and ID verified, Member's subscription payments reactivate from that date forward. Member will not be enrolled in automatic recurring payments until they have received an access keycard.
    3. Member now has full access to the space and all benefits provided. Dues will be automatically charged against whichever payment method Member originally used to sign up, with the next payment starting one month after Member's ID was verified and their keycard was issued. Member can modify their payment method at any time through the website.
    4. Membership dues will continue to be charged on the subscription interval (generally Monthly on the same day of activation unless otherwise specified), until either Member cancels, fails to pay, or has their Membership status revoked.
    5. If Member cancels their own Membership, they will continue to have full access to all Member benefits until the date of what would be their next renewal, at which point the membership will be officially cancelled.
    6. Any Member who has their Membership terminated due to disciplinary action, violation of policies, or anything else that would place them in a position of poor standing with the organization, is ineligible to re-purchase a membership without approval from the Board.

**Benefits of Membership**
