**Definitions**

5. **The Website.** "Website" refers to the site running at denhac.org, which all members use for signing up, providing profile/contact information, saving payment methods, voting in member-only polls, and other such functions. Most all denhac services interact with the website in some capacity.

**Membership**

1. **Agreement, Limitation of Liability & Waiver**
    All members, guests, and participants enter into this Agreement as a condition of membership and as a part of participating in denhac activities and/or events, and extends to denhac and its affiliates. All members, guests, and participants have read, understood, agreed to, and have signed [denhac's "Waiver and Release of Liability, Indemnification and Assumption of Risk, and Hold Harmless Agreement"](http://denhac.org/waiver) herein called "Waiver," which will be provided simultaneously with this Membership Agreement prior to the use of facilities and/or attendance at any activity of denhac. No member or non-member is permitted to use the facilities, participate in any activity, use tools, or machinery for any reason without the acceptance and signing of the Waiver. Acceptance of this Membership Agreement, entering our facilities, or participating in any activity expressly assumes risks covered in our waiver and implicitly constitutes acceptance of the waiver as well.

2. **Membership Term**

    The Membership Term and Member's obligations to pay monthly Membership Dues will be structured as follows:
    1. Pending Member signs up online through the website. Their payment is accepted, saved, and their account is created. The membership subscription is immediately paused, and no further payments will be collected until Member has been issued a keycard. They are provided instructions to visit the space in person in order to have their ID verified and to be issued an access keycard.
    2. Pending Member visits the space, speaks with a denhac Agent, has their ID verified, and is issued an access keycard to the building. Keycards usually activate within a few minutes. When a keycard is issued and ID verified, Member's subscription payments reactivate from that date forward. Member will not be enrolled in automatic recurring payments until they have received an access keycard.
    3. Member now has full access to the space and all benefits provided. Dues will be automatically charged against whichever payment method Member originally used to sign up, with the next payment starting one month after Member's ID was verified and their keycard was issued. Member can modify their payment method at any time through the website.
    4. Membership dues will continue to be charged on the subscription interval (generally Monthly on the same day of activation unless otherwise specified), until either Member cancels, fails to pay, or has their Membership status revoked.
    5. If Member cancels their own Membership, they will continue to have full access to all Member benefits until the date of what would be their next renewal, at which point the membership will be officially cancelled.
    6. Any Member who has their Membership terminated due to disciplinary action, violation of policies, or anything else that would place them in a position of poor standing with the organization, is ineligible to re-purchase a membership without approval from the Board.

**Benefits of Membership**

In addition to use of the Hackerspace indicated above, Member's benefits of Membership include the following:

1. **Building Access**
   Membership allows 24-hour access to the Hackerspace and Common Areas of the Building via RFID keycards issued by denhac.

Additionally, the container must be clearly labeled with the Member's name, Member Code (found in the Account section of the website), or both. The container must be stored with the member label visible from the outside.

It is against policy for any Member to take items from another Member's storage unless said item is an apparent and obvious hazard (electrical, biological, radioactive, etc).

**Hackerspace Use**

Member understands that the Hackerspace is intended to be used only as an individual's work space, and that Member may not offer classes or regular individual instruction in the Hackerspace or anywhere else in the Building unless specifically authorized by denhac to do so. Member is explicitly prohibited from using denhac or any associated resources in the pursuit of any commercial or for-profit activity.

1. **Liability Waiver**
   [denhac's Liability Waiver](http://denhac.org/waiver) is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Member agrees to be bound by the terms of the liability waiver as attached and as may be modified from time to time by denhac. If and when modified, Member will be provided with an updated version. Failure to agree to any updated liability waiver may be considered cause for denhac's termination of this Agreement.

2. **Non-Exclusivity**

**Non-discrimination and diversity statement**

denhac does not promote or discriminate against any person, population group, or organization with regard to categories protected by applicable United States law. These include, but are not limited to race, color, religion, sex, gender expression, sexuality, physical appearance, language, education background, national origin, age, disability, and veteran status.

denhac strives to create an inclusive environment where everyone can feel welcome and respected in our space. While there is not a formal hierarchy here as in a workplace, everyone comes into our space with their own different histories and social norms. We on the Board of Directors expect members to both communicate with each other about the boundaries/limits you each wish to hold, and respect when someone else communicates a boundary with you. If a member deliberately oversteps a boundary that is clearly expressed to them (whether in person, over Slack messages, or via other means) it will be treated as a violation of our anti-harassment policy and the board may need to take disciplinary action, if relevant. Initial communication of a boundary can be done without direct board member support in most cases, but please reach out to any member of the Board of Directors if you would like support of any kind in any phase of the process of boundary setting.

If you feel that you have been harassed at denhac or if someone has made you uncomfortable (even if you arenâ€™t sure if itâ€™s harassment), we on the Board of Directors encourage you to follow the reporting procedure in our code of conduct. Everyone can help make denhac better, and creating a safe environment for everyone is important to making denhac better. Board members canâ€™t act to officially address potential issues if we arenâ€™t made aware of them.

**Code of conduct and anti-harassment policy**

We, the denhac Board of Directors, expect everyone involved in our community to follow this code of conduct. This applies to all of our methods of communication.

denhac does not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form. 

Behavior considered as harassment includes, but is not limited to:

1. Offensive comments including epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, verbal kidding, teasing, jokes, or intimidating acts related to race, religion, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, or physical appearance. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.
2. Gratuitous sexual or obscene objects, images, discussions, or behavior
3. Physical contact, romantic advances, sexual attention, or other contact or messaging that continues after a request to stop or a negative/"no" response
4. Physical contact, sexual or romantic attention, or other actions where informed and voluntary consent can be expected to be received, but was not received in advance
5. Subtle or explicit demands for sexual or romantic activity
6. Physical or verbal abuse
7. Threats or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to engage in self-harm
8. Deliberate intimidation by words, gestures, body language, or menacing behavior
9. Stalking
10. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
11. Continued one-on-one contact or communication after active requests to cease or other indicators of a lack of consent (such as a pattern of sending multiple long messages that are not necessary to space operations and that receive no response)
12. Deliberate outing/sharing of a sensitive aspect of a personâ€™s identity without their consent
13. Deliberate misgendering. This includes dead-naming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a personâ€™s gender identity.
14. Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated this code of conduct 

How to submit a harassment report
Reports should be submitted in writing (e.g. on Slack or via denhac.org email) to any member of our Board of Directors, listed at https://denhac.org/wiki/the-board; the entire board is also available via email at board@denhac.org. If your report is given to a single member of the board, they will ask to pull in a second board member of your choice, to share the detailed context of the issue in order to better represent it to the rest of the board and help address the issue.

What happens when a harassment report is submitted
Report information will be shared and discussed privately over board-only slack and/or private board executive session - current board members are the only ones present at the time of discussion, but future board members may have access to the discussion log as well. Board members will investigate the report privately (potentially including use of our camera footage but we will check in with the reporter before taking any actions which might reidentify the reporter to a harasser), discuss and decide on next steps to address the incident, and communicate back to the reporter on the next steps chosen within a week after the next Executive Session completes. Anonymous summaries of public events that require a statement, and/or summary statistics around incident management, may also be shared more widely across denhac for transparency.

Potential consequences of violating the code of conduct
denhac reserves the right to terminate any membership at any time for any reason, but the Board of Directors strives for the process to be as fair and open as privacy and discretion allow us to be. Upon breaching of the denhac rules and member agreements, the following actions may be performed in any order:

* The member will get a verbal warning from a Director or a Manager.
* The member will be called before the Board to explain and/or discuss the behavior in question, usually within Executive Session.
* The member will receive a formal Warning, via letter or email, signed by a board member.
* The member will be put on probation.
* Membership will be suspended for a length of time.
* Membership will be terminated.

Note that some offenses â€“ such as non-payment of dues, or negligence leading to danger to our members or physical space â€“ can trigger automatic membership suspension or termination, without a formal review by the Board.
Definitions of suspension and termination can be found in our [membership agreements](https://github.com/Denhac/denhac-official-docs/blob/main/membership-agreement.md).
