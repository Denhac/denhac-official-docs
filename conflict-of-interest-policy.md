# I. Overview 
#### 1. Purpose
The purpose of this Conflict of Interest and Compensation Policy (the “policy”) is to protect the Organization’s interests when it is considering taking an action or entering into a transaction that might benefit the private interests of a director, officer or key person[^1], result in the payment of excessive compensation to a director, officer or key person; 
or otherwise violate state and federal laws governing conflicts of interest applicable to nonprofit, charitable organizations.

#### 2. Why is a policy necessary?
As a nonprofit, charitable organization, the Organization is accountable to both government agencies and members of the public for responsible and proper use of its resources.
Directors, officers and employees have a duty to act in the Organization’s best interests and may not use their positions for their own financial or personal benefit.
Conflicts of interest must be taken very seriously since they can damage the Organization’s reputation and expose both the Organization and affiliated individuals to legal liability if not handled appropriately. 
Even the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided, as it could undermine public support for the Organization.

### 3. To whom does the policy apply?
This policy applies to all directors, officers and key persons (“you”).

# II. Identifying Conflicts of Interest
#### 1. What is a conflict of interest?
A potential conflict of interest arises when a director, officer or key person, or that person’s relative[^2] or business: 
- (a) stands to gain a financial benefit from an action the Organization takes or a transaction into which the Organization enters; or
- (b) has another interest that impairs, or could be seen to impair, the independence or objectivity of the director, officer or key person in discharging their duties to the Organization.
#### 3. In situations where you are uncertain, err on the side of caution and disclose the potential conflict as set forth in Section III of this policy.
#### 4. A potential conflict is not necessarily a conflict of interest. A person has a conflict of interest only if the audit committee decides, pursuant to Section IV of this policy, that a conflict of interest exists.

# III. Disclosing Potential Conflicts of Interest
1. You must disclose to the best of your knowledge all potential conflicts of interest as soon as you become aware of them and always before any actions involving the potential conflict are taken.
2. Submit a signed, notrized, written statement disclosing all the material facts to to the treasurer or other individual as designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors.
3. You must file an annual disclosure statement. If you are a director, you must also file this statement prior to your initial election or apon re-elction.
4. Submit the form to the treasurer or other individual as designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors.

# IV. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists
#### 1. After there has been disclosure of a potential conflict and after gathering any relevant information from the concerned director, officer or key person, the audit committee shall determine whether there is a conflict of interest. 
The director, officer or key person shall not be present for deliberation or vote on the matter and must not attempt to influence improperly the determination of whether a conflict of interest exists.
#### 2. In determining whether a conflict of interest exists, the audit committee shall consider whether the potential conflict of interest would cause a transaction entered into by the Organization to raise questions of bias, inappropriate use of the Organization’s assets, or any other impropriety. 
#### 3. A conflict always exists in the case of a related party transaction – a transaction, agreement or other arrangement in which a related party [^3] has a financial interest and in which the Organization or any affiliate of the Organization is a participant. [^4]
#### 4. If the audit committee determines that there is a conflict of interest, it shall refer the matter to the board of directors (“board”).

# V. Procedures for Addressing a Conflict of Interest
#### 1. When a matter involving a conflict of interest comes before the board, the board may seek information from the director, officer or key person with the conflict prior to beginning deliberation and reaching a decision on the matter. However, a conflicted person shall not be present during the discussion or vote on the matter and must not attempt to influenc improperly the deliberation or vote.
#### 2. Additional Procedures for Addressing Related Party Transactions
- a. the Organization may not enter into a related party transaction unless, after good faith disclosure of the material facts by the director, officer or key person, the board or a committee authorized by the board determines that the transaction is fair, reasonable and in the Organization's best interest at the time of such determination.
- b. If the related party has a substantial financial interest, the board or authorized committee shall:
-- i. prior to entering into the transaction, consider alternative transactions to the extent available;
-- ii. approve the transaction by a vote of not less than a majority of the directors present at the meeting; and
-- iii. contemporaneously document in writing the basis for its approval, including its consideration of any alternative transactions.

# VI. Minutes and Documentation

conflict of interest was discussed or voted upon shall include:
- a. the name of the interested party and the nature of the interest;
- b. the decision as to whether the interest presented a conflict of interest;

#### 2. In the case of compensation of Key Persons, the following additional procedures apply:

- b. The board or authorized committee shall base approval of compensation on appropriate data, including compensation paid by comparable organizations (three are sufficient if the Organization’s income is less than $1,000,000) for functionally similar positions, availability of similar services in the geographic area of the Organization,
  and compensation surveys compiled by independent firms.
