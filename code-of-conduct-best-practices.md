# Best practices for interaction at denhac


## What does this document aim to do?

Our code of conduct covers the minimum standards for behavior at denhac, what behavior is unacceptable, and what happens when potentially unacceptable behavior is reported to the board of directors. This official policy document is meant as an additional document covering "best practices". In general, the idea is that denhac members and visitors aren't constantly toeing the line of acceptability and asking the board to adjudicate every interpersonal dispute, but are instead trying to be actively good to one another and avoid getting to the point where disputes become harassment. 

This document lists examples to help guide our community in thinking through how each of us can respond to potential issues, and how we can react when we experience potentially unacceptable behavior, whether directed at ourselves or others. 

## The short version

Some guidelines on behavior:

* If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, err on the side of caution. Seek and receive informed consent in advance.
* Each person you interact with can define what is appropriate for them. When a boundary is set it is your responsibility to ensure that your behavior does not have a negative impact. Intent is one input towards determining a negative impact but it is not the only important context.
* Problems happen when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm or ok with everyone. Everyone has their own perspective; be mindful and consider the perspectives of the other people present. An uncaught assumption can be particularly harmful to others when we are in a position of power or privilege. 

## The longer version

### Seeking and receiving informed consent in advance

Our code of conduct states that repeated behavior after being told to stop is prohibited (though we do call out touch and romantic/sexual behaviors as especially risky), and for the behaviors in that list where it is possible to receive consent in advance, you need to receive consent first. This is something that can be done in many small ways through all interactions, not just with a predefined list of risky behaviors.

Examples in practice: If you want to make a joke about yourself, are you sure there's nobody there who could think it was a harmful comment about them - how would you know? There are many opportunities in a conversation to get a small positive signal that other people feel comfortable, a quick question that allows someone to know if they want to opt out doesn't have to be a large ordeal. 

### Defining what is appropriate for you and setting boundaries

Boundary setting is the process of communicating specifics about how you do or don't want to be treated. Anyone can set a boundary for themselves that doesn't impact other people in a harmful way. e.g. "I don't want you to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention, please wave from a distance or say my name" is a good boundary to set if the person doesn't want to be tapped on the shoulder. "I don't want you to wear the color red in the woodshop" is another example of a boundary, but it does impact people in a harmful way, so it wouldn't be a good boundary to set within denhac. You don't need the board of directors involved to set a boundary, but if a reasonable boundary is violated once it's set, it can be grounds for board actions around our code of conduct and anti-harassment policy.

Examples in practice: When something bothers you, when do you tell someone directly and unambiguously, and when do you ignore it and hope for the best? When you do something that bothers someone else, how do you know it's bothered them? It's better for everyone involved when you can trust someone will listen to you when you say are hurt - how can you help someone else by listening when they need that? 

### Everyone has their own perspective

denhac's membership is diverse and comes from different backgrounds, histories and experiences. Problems in communication may occur when we assume that everyone shares our viewpoints or ways of thinking. Careless words and actions can affect other people in unintended ways. 

Examples in practice: It can be respectful to check in with the people in a conversation if you realize you may have misread a situation based on their reaction. It's important to approach that conversation with genuine interest and curiosity in their perspective, rather than while trying to make a point yourself. A denhac community where we all care about how other people see the world is a denhac where we can make friends and strengthen our community support network.

### Power and privilege

While denhac is a volunteer-only organization, and there isn't that much opportunity for hierarchical power within the space, we do not exist outside society at large. All of us have experienced power dynamics in the rest of the world, and all of us bring that context with us when we join denhac, and use that to inform how we treat others here.

Examples in practice: Someone might not like to be singled out for something they can't control (for example, an identity). You might not like to be given advice on something you already know about - when you are giving advice, ask first whether the advice is wanted, think first about if it's advice you would give anyone or if you are assuming someone is a newcomer, and especially if it is novice-friendly information consider whether someone else here may have already given this person the advice you're offering or if it needs to be now.
