# Process notes and drafted changes, for vote in November 2024:

## Changes to new joiner messaging

The following should be read to every new member when they join, in addition to the existing practices and guidelines that appear when a key card is activated:

* No Harassment: This includes, but is not limited to, attention that comes after a request to stop. Our anti-harassment policy is part of our member agreement - please read it.
* No Bullying: Recognize and respect everyoneâ€™s differences. Treat all members with kindness and respect.


## New procedure/form for code of conduct incident reporting

Board members should collect the following standard information when receiving an incident report. This may be an online form in the future but isn't being added as one as a part of this proposal.

* Uniquely identifiable name of the reporter (Slack handle or full name)
* Date/time of report
* How would you like us to contact you about this concern/incident?
* Confidentiality: We strive to keep all incidents confidential within the board, and to follow up with you before any follow up actions we take that could risk reidentifying you to a harasser. Is there any additional concern you have, or special handling that you need to request? (e.g. if a board member caused the incident, or if there is a time-sensitive concern)
* Details of the issue/incident:
  * Who?
  * What?
  * When?
  * Where?
  * How?
* If there is any action you'd like to request that the board takes in response to this specific incident - let us know here. It may not be possible to take this action exactly as described, but we would like to respect your autonomy as much as we can in resolving this incident.
* Please share any additional suggestions you have about how to prevent issues like this from happening.
