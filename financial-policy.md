## How We Collect Money

### Membership Dues:
When a member registers for a denhac account, they will save a card on file with our card processor, Stripe. Under our Membership Agreement, a Membership is not considered active until an ID check has been performed. The member will be charged using the card on file with Stripe at the time of Access Card Activation. Membership dues are collected using Stripe on a monthly recurring basis. If we cannot charge the card on file for whatever reason, the member will be notified by Stripe and given four days to update their information. During this time, the member will still have access to the space, but after the failed attempt to charge their card, their membership will be terminated. The member can immediately update their form of payment after their membership termination and purchase a new membership.

Current membership costs are posted in our Membership Agreement. All membership dues of current members will remain the same unless the impacted members are notified of this change within a reasonable amount of time approved by the Board.

#### Cancellation Policy:
At any time, a member can request to cancel their membership, effective at the start of their next renewal date. This request can be made through our website or by reaching out to the Treasurer. The Treasurer may approve other cancellation options on a case-by-case basis. 

Any attempts to dispute a valid membership charge without a cancellation request will be treated as a cancellation request. The member will be prevented from obtaining a new membership unless the Treasurer approves.

### Monetary Donations:
From time to time, we will receive monetary donations from a member or third-party charity (Amazon Smile). All donations will be deposited into our general fund for space use unless otherwise directed by the donor. In this case, we will attempt to use the funds as directed and as circumstances permit.

### Grants:
From time to time, we will receive grants from organizations. All grants will be spent per the grant documentation. Should no specific use be called out, funds will be deposited into our general fund for space use.

## How we Spend our Money

### Board Approved Funds (AKA: Project Funds):
#### Approval:
Any member in good standing can submit a project request to the Board. Should these requests require funds from the general balance, the Treasurer will confirm if the funds are available, and the Board will vote to approve the project and requested funds.

Once approved, an official Project Fund will be created, and the member will be considered the Project Owner. Project Ownership can be transferred between members in good standing as long as both are aware and have confirmed with the Treasurer.

#### Updates:
The Treasurer will provide a monthly summary of all active Project Funds and their remaining balances. The Treasurer will also check in with the Project Owner every ~3 months to ensure the project is still active and funds are still required. Check-in can be skipped at the Treasurer's discretion.

#### Project Closure:
A project will be considered closed when all funds have been dispersed or when the Project Owner has informed the Treasurer that the funds are no longer required. The Treasurer will report any Project closures to the Board monthly and any funds returning to the general balance.

#### Abandoned Project:
A project will be considered abandoned when no funds have been dispersed after 90 days and no update has been provided to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will report any Abandoned Projects to the Board monthly and any funds returning to the general balance.

### Recurring Operating Funds (AKA: Manager Budgets):
#### Approval:
When requested by an acting Manager, the Board can approve a recurring operating fund that a Manager can use at their discretion for their area of business. The Treasurer will confirm if funds are available in the general balance.

#### Updates:
The Treasurer will provide a monthly summary of all active Manager Budgets and their spending. The Treasurer will also check in with the acting Manager every ~ six (6) months to ensure the funding is appropriate and will help guide a request to increase or decrease funds. Check-in can be skipped at the Treasurer's discretion.

### Special Intrest Group (SIG) Budgets:
#### Approval:
When requested by an approved Special Interest Group, the Board can approve a recurring operating fund that the SIG can use at their discretion for their area of business. The Treasurer will confirm if funds are available in the general balance. The scope of the SIG's charter will determine the area where items can be purchased for.

#### Updates:
The Treasurer will provide a monthly summary of all active SIG Budgets and their spending. The Treasurer will also check in with the acting SIG Leaders every ~ three (3) months to ensure the funding is appropriate and will help guide a request to increase or decrease funds. Check-in can be skipped at the Treasurer's discretion.

### Vending Machine Pool:
In the case of the denhac-owned vending machines, a pool of funds will be set aside for stocking, maintenance, and general improvements. This pool will generate its funds through the machines' revenue until the approved cap is reached. Once reached, all collected funds will be added to the general fund. The Treasurer will report on the current funds in the pool monthly.

The currently approved pool is $1,000.

## Fund Disbursement:
Project funds will be dispersed through reimbursement, a dedicated project card issued by Stripe, or direct-to-vendor payment made by the Treasurer.

Manager Budgets will be dispersed through a dedicated card issued by Stripe under the Manager's name, reimbursement, or direct-to-vendor payment made by the Treasurer.

A Project Owner can authorize a member to spend funds on behalf of their project. All reimbursement requests should be sent to treasurer@denhac.org. Reimbursements will be sent through PayPal; however, other reimbursement methods can be requested at the Treasurer's discretion.

A Manager can authorize a member to spend funds under their budget. All reimbursement requests should be sent to treasurer@denhac.org. Reimbursements will be sent through PayPal; however, other reimbursement methods can be requested at the Treasurer's discretion.

For reimbursement to be approved, the following will be required:
- Budget Name
- Manager CC'd (if not the submitter)
- Area (If Applicable) (i.e., 3D Printer, Laser, Woodshop...)
- Copy of Receipt
- Total Amount to be reimbursed
- Paypal address or preferred reimbursement method

Additionally, all receipts should be provided to the Treasurer within a reasonable timeframe:
- Project Funds: 30 days from the date of purchase or before noon on the last business Friday of the Fiscal Year (whichever is sooner)
- Monthly Budgets: 30 days from the date of purchase if a Stripe Card was used, before the end of the month if a reimbursement is required, or before noon on the last business Friday of the Fiscal Year (whichever is sooner)

If a receipt can not be provided in a reasonable timeframe, please email Treasurer@denhac.org so they are aware. If this deadline is continually missed, the Treasurer will work with the Board to determine appropriate action including, but not limited to, removing a member's ability to spend money on behalf of denhac. 

**A receipt will be required for all transactions or reimbursements with no exceptions.**
