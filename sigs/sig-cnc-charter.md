# CNC Special Interest Group

The CNC SIG is responsible for the maintenance, governance, and administration of the CNC routers, adjacent equipment, and space at denhac.

The group will respond to requests from denhac members for future needs and will help create recommendations to the board that require funding in excess of the budget provided to the SIG by the denhac board of directors.

## Roles and Responsible Parties

The CNC SIG will be led by two Co-Leads, and a group of appointed Trainers/Maintainers. 

General responsibilities for these Roles (this is not an exhaustive list):

* The SIG Co-Leads will be generally responsible for SIG project management and/or delegation of these responsibilities, as well as the general governance of the group's actions at large.
* SIG Co-Leads are responsible for the appointments of properly qualified Maintainers and Trainers, as well as providing any extended training required for both.
* Maintainers will support the Co-Leads in matters regarding the upkeep and management of machines.
* Trainers will be responsible for authorizing members to use the machines safely and providing assistance with machine usage when appropriate.
* There is not a fixed number of Maintainer and Trainer positions available; they are filled based on demonstrated skill, merit, enthusiasm, and member demand for the machines.

## Scope of the CNC SIG

The CNC SIG exists to facilitate safe and effective usage of the CNC routing equipment at denhac. This group will maintain CNC equipment, respond to future events and large scale projects proposed by the membership, as well as oversee additions and changes to the CNC routing space and equipment within denhac.

#### ***In-Scope***

* Maintaining denhac-owned CNC routers and associated hardware including the computing infrastructure required to operate the machines
* Resources for use and maintenance specific to the CNC routers such as workholding, calibration tools, etc
* Project support and collaboration with other sigs and future denhac events
* Maintenance and Improvements to the CNC routers (Shapeoko 5 Pro, Space Owned CNC Mill/Routers) and related space within denhac
* Responding to and managing the use of donated CNC routers and equipment
* Responding to and managing the use of member-owned CNC routing equipment on loan to denhac
* Addressing membership concerns and questions specific to equipment within the CNC router area
* Disciplinary measures such as removal of CNC authorization or related privileges
* Managing the spending and allocation of SIG funds, as well as coordinating Board Requests for additional funds
* Creating and teaching a comprehensive curriculum regarding safe and effective usage of the CNC routers to all interested and permitted members
* Defining the required knowledge needed for Authorized Trainers and Maintainers, as well as providing this knowledge to certify denhac members as Trainers and Maintainers of the CNC routers when appropriate
* Defining policy regarding specific materials and end effectors that are approved for use with the CNC routers at denhac

#### ***Out-of-Scope***

* Maintenance and upkeep of member-owned CNC machines that aren't for use by denhac members
* Member-owned materials
* Anything not specifically listed as In-Scope, or as determined by the SIG Leads

## Organization Management

SIG decisions will be made by the SIG leads, who should strongly take into consideration the sentiments of any denhac member with a special interest in the CNC routers on site, while ultimately acting in the best interests of denhac as a whole. SIG leads are encouraged to make decisions using majority votes from CNC SIG members. Decisions made by the CNC SIG leads can always be overridden by the denhac board of directors.

Amendments to this charter can be made during group meetings by vote between SIG members and Leads, or by the denhac board of directors at any time according to the rules in place for modifications to denhac's own bylaws.

## Communications

Official SIG communication will be conducted through the denhac Slack workspace in the following channels:

* Public: #sig-cnc, #help-cnc
* Private: #cnc_trainers

## Meetings

Meetings will be organized on Slack, appear on the Google Calendar, and will be held at least once a month. Meetings will be conducted at denhac whenever possible or perhaps remotely via video conference. Any active denhac member with a special interest in denhac's CNC router facilities is invited to attend, and any denhac member can elect to be a member of the SIG by simply joining the #sig-cnc slack channel.
