# denhac's Record Retention and Destruction Policies
These policies cover all records regardless of physical form or characteristics which have been made or received by denhac in the course of doing business.

## I. Purpose of policies
These policies provide for the systematic review, retention and destruction of records received or created by denhac in connection with the transaction of business.
These policies cover all records, regardless of physical form, contain guidelines for how long certain records should be kept and how records should be destroyed.
These policies are designed to ensure compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, to eliminate accidental or innocent destruction of records and to facilitate denhac’s operations by promoting efficiency and freeing up valuable storage space.
Included in the federal laws necessitating compliance with these policies is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("The American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002"), which makes it a crime to alter, cover up, falsify, or destroy any document with the intent of impeding or obstructing any official proceeding.

## II. Records covered
These policies apply to all records in any form, including electronic documents.
A record is any material that contains information about denhac’s plans, results, policies or performance. 
Anything that can be represented with words or numbers is a business record for purposes of these policies.
Electronic documents must be retained as if they were paper documents. 
Therefore, any electronic files, including information received on line, that fall into one of the document types on the schedule must be maintained for the appropriate amount of time.
[For example, if a user has sufficient reason to keep an email message, the message should be printed in hard copy and kept in the appropriate file or moved to an “archive” computer file folder.]
[Backup and recovery methods will be tested on a regular basis.]

## III. Record Retention
denhac follows the document retention procedures outlined below.
Documents that are not listed, but are substantially similar to those listed in the schedule will be retained for the appropriate length of time. 
denhac will subscribe to the 3-2-1 principle of data protection which is derfined as three copys of all data being retained (one primary, two backups), on atleast two diffrent forms of media, with at least one copy being secured in off-site storage. 
Although this practice may change by direction of the Treasurer or individual designated by the Chairperson of the Board, the initial practice of retention will be as follows:
  - 3. Google Drive (Primary), Local Network Storage (Backup-1), External Storage Media (Backup-2)
  - 2. Cloud Storage, Local Network Storage, Extrnal Storage Drive 
  - 1. External Storage Drive which will be secured in a safety deposit box accessible by the Treasurer and Chairperson. 

### A. Permanent Retention
Permanent records—Permanent records are records required by law to be permanently retained and which are ineligible for destruction at any time for any reason. 
These records are necessary for the continuity of business and the protection of the rights and interests of the organization and of individuals. 
These include records such as organizational documents (Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws), Board minutes and policies, federal and state tax exempt status and independent audits.
No record, whether or not referenced, may be destroyed if in any way the records refer to, concern, arise out of or in any other way are involved in pending or threatened litigation.
While the listings below contain commonly recognized categories of records, the list should not be considered as having identified all records that denhac may need to consider for permanent and non-permanent status. 
In particular, and as noted above, any documents that are, or may be involved in pending or threatened litigation, must be retained. 
The nonprofit’s legal counsel should be asked to assist in determining what records must be retained.
